# Employee-Attrition-Tableau-Dashboard
A Tableau Dashboard project developing and showcasing my skills in building a variety of visualisations and analysis in Tableau. 
This project looks at employee attrition / reduction in staff numbers and investigates the several variables that may account for this when operating on their own or together such as age, gender, department, job satisfaction, education level, and education field.
