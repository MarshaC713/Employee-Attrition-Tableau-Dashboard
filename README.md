# Employee-Attrition-Tableau-Dashboard
A Tableau Dashboard project developing and showcasing my skills in building a variety of visualisations and analysis in Tableau. 
This project looks at employee attrition / reduction in staff numbers and investigates the several variables that may account for this when operating on their own or together such as age, gender, department, job satisfaction, education level, and education field.

Filters can be applied via the education filter st the top of the dashboard or by clicking on segments of the Department Wise Attrition piechart, the green  No. of Employees by Age Group vertical barchart, or via the pink Attrition by Education Field horizontal barchart.

### Employee KPI's

The first visualisation along the top of the dashboard, is a set of KPI's which examines: Employee Count, Atrrition Rate, Active Employee, and Average Age. All of which are susceptible to differences in the education level of employees as shown in the demo below.  In this demo, I used the Education filter at the top of the dashboard to filter for differing levels of education.
